# Description

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL. I have designed database schema containing three tables: Departmemt, Role and Employee. Then I built a command line application that allows users to Add, Update and View Departments, Roles and Employees.
